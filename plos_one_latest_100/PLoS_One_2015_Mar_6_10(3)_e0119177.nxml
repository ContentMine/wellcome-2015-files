Recent evidence showed that SXR and PXR are also expressed in bone tissue where they mediate bone metabolism. Here we report that systemic deletion of PXR results in aging-dependent wearing of articular cartilage of knee joints. Histomorphometrical analysis showed remarkable reduction of width and an enlarged gap between femoral and tibial articular cartilage in PXR knockout mice. We hypothesized that genes induced by SXR in chondrocytes have a protective effect on articular cartilage and identified Fam20a (family with sequence similarity 20a) as an SXR-dependent gene induced by the known SXR ligands, rifampicin and vitamin K2. Lastly, we demonstrated the biological significance of Fam20a expression in chondrocytes by evaluating osteoarthritis-related gene expression of primary articular chondrocytes. Consistent with epidemiological findings, our results indicate that SXR/PXR protects against aging-dependent wearing of articular cartilage and that ligands for SXR/PXR have potential role in preventing osteoarthritis caused by aging.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by: 1) Cell Innovation Program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cell-innovation.nig.ac.jp/mext-life/english/html/program/theme.html">http://cell-innovation.nig.ac.jp/mext-life/english/html/program/theme.html</ext-link>) (SI); 2) Grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Research Project number: 24659126 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kaken.nii.ac.jp/d/p/24659126.en.html">http://kaken.nii.ac.jp/d/p/24659126.en.html</ext-link>) (SI); 3) Grants-in-Aid from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/kenkyuujigyou/hojokin-koubo16/05-01.html">http://www.mhlw.go.jp/bunya/kenkyuujigyou/hojokin-koubo16/05-01.html</ext-link>) (SI); 4) Grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Grant number R01ES021832 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/portfolio/index.cfm/portfolio/grantDetail/grant_number/R01ES021832">http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/portfolio/index.cfm/portfolio/grantDetail/grant_number/R01ES021832</ext-link>) (BB); 5) NIH Predoctoral Cancer Biology Training Grant, T32CA9054, National Cancer Institute (SCC).

These phenotypes are similar to those of osteoarthritis seen in elderly people. We then examined when this osteoarthritis-like phenotype develops in PXRKO mice. We evaluated the width of the lateral articular cartilage of the tibia in 4-month-old female PXRKO mice and WT mice. In contrast to aged mice, 4-month-old PXRKO mice displayed no significant differences in the width of the lateral articular cartilage compared with control mice (<xref rid="pone.0119177.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).

These results indicate that SXR/PXR signaling has protective roles in cartilage tissue. We previously reported that SXR/PXR has protective roles in bone tissue [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is interesting to note that SXR/PXR signaling thus affects both of the important components of skeletal tissue, bone and cartilage. Since our analysis is based on only female data, future studies would be needed to address whether the results are also applicable in male mice.</p><p>The width of articular cartilage could be influenced by formation of cartilage matrix, its degradation, and accumulation of physical damage. In our experiment, differences in cartilage width between PXR knockout mice and wild type mice were not evident until 8 months of age. This indicates a possible contribution of cumulative damage over time to this phenotype. It may also be possible that decreased production of cartilage matrix becomes more evident in aged PXRKO mice. We noticed that damage in the surface of the cartilage was milder than expected considering the decreased width of the cartilage in PXRKO mice and that the lesion is not identical to typical osteoarthritis. This may be because we are only observing age-related changes without interventions that cause joint instability such as ligament cutting.</p><p>SXR/PXR is expressed in human and murine primary chondrocytes; therefore, we hypothesized that SXR/PXR might have a physiological role in chondrocytes. We performed microarray analysis using ATDC5 cells overexpressing SXR and identified several candidate SXR responsive genes using hierarchical cluster analysis. The candidate genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR; Fam20a was most strongly induced by both SXR agonists tested&#x02014;rifampicin and vitamin K2. We found a consensus SXR/PXR responsive element motif in the first intron of both human and murine Fam20a genes and showed Fam20a is a primary responsive gene using reporter assays testing the identified SXR/PXR responsive element. Decreased expression of Fam20a in primary chondrocytes from PXRKO mice further supports our identification of Fam20a as an SXR responsive gene in chondrocyte. We note that these primary chondrocytes are derived from cartilage of newly born pups which do not reflect damaged cartilage in aged mice; thus, loss of Fam20a expression precedes the cartilage wearing phenotype. To understand the critical stage when expression of Fam20a is important for cartilage protection, further evaluation of Fam20a expression in both developing and aged pathological cartilage will be the subject of a future study.</p><p>Fam20a is a secreted protein that was originally described in hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mutations in human FAM20A were shown to cause amelogenesis imperfecta and gingival hyperplasia [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fam20a knockout mice were recently reported to have defects in the enamel layer of their teeth and ectopic calcification in arteries throughout their body [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the phenotypes of articular cartilage were not reported in humans or mice, Fam20a may be related to regulation of the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, Fam20b, which belongs to the same family as Fam20a, was shown to be expressed in chondrocytes in zebrafish and to play important roles in endochondral ossification [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although no role for Fam20b in articular chondrocytes has yet been reported, these lines of evidence suggest that Fam20 family proteins also have some functions in the articular cartilage. We also noted decreased expression of Col2a1 in Fam20a knock-down chondrocytes. Since Fam20a is a secreted protein, it is conceivable that it regulates signaling from the extracellular matrix and affects cartilage turnover. We did not observe SXR-dependent induction of Fam20b or Fam20c in our microarray experiment, suggesting that SXR regulates only Fam20a among Fam20 family genes.</p><p>We previously showed that vitamin K2 functions as an agonist of SXR/PXR [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], independently of the previously known function of vitamin K as a co-factor for gamma carboxylation of substrate proteins [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The results of the current study suggest that activation of SXR/PXR is one of the mechanisms underlying the cartilage-protective effective of vitamin K shown by several epidemiological studies [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that vitamin K activity mediated by gamma carboxylation of substrate proteins also plays role in articular cartilage. MGP (matrix gla protein) is a well-known substrate of gamma carboxylase in cartilage tissue [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Because MGP knockout mice die before the age of three months as a result of aortic rupture [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the role of MGP in articular cartilage in aged mice remains unknown.</p><p>As in bone tissues, uncoupled turnover was shown to cause osteoarthritis based on serum levels of N-propeptide of type IIA procollagen (PIIANP) and urinary excretion of C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) as cartilage specific turnover markers [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Considering the cartilage-protective effect shown in epidemiological studies and our results indicating that SXR/PXR signaling affects type II collagen synthesis, we can expect a therapeutic effect for at least some SXR agonists in osteoarthritis. However, to the best of our knowledge, the only randomized controlled study to date failed to show a therapeutic effect of vitamin K for treatment of patients with osteoarthritis [<xref rid="pone.0119177.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. That study was performed for three years, which might have been be too short an interval to affect cartilage turnover, or a more potent SXR/PXR agonist may be required to modify cartilage turnover in osteoarthritis. It is also possible that vitamin K has a disease-modifying effect, not in established osteoarthritis but rather in the developing phase when a preventive role can be still expected.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here for the first time that PXRKO mice displayed an osteoarthritis-like phenotype by performing histomorphometrical analyses of the articular cartilage. We identified Fam20a as a novel SXR/PXR responsive gene that is a candidate regulator of turnover in cartilage tissue. Although the clinical value of SXR agonists including vitamin K in osteoarthritis remains to be determined, our findings could help in the development of novel preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119177.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Signal intensities of microarray data from the cluster including SXR-dependent ligand-induced genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119177.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Masami Muramatsu (Research Center for Genomic Medicine, Saitama Medical University) for critical discussion.
