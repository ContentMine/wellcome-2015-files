Much less is known about the prevalence of negative symptoms in the population, including poverty of thought and speech, impoverished emotional experience, diminished affect, decreased motivation toward goal-directed behavior, and decreased social drive [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The only population-based report on negative symptoms in the general population is a recent longitudinal study by Dominguez and colleagues[<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], that found that 15.7% of adolescents and young adults reported lifetime cumulative incidence of negative/disorganized symptoms alone, and 5.5% reported both positive and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms were predictive of positive symptoms over time, and particularly the co-occurrence of positive and negative symptoms was associated with increased probability of functional impairment and help-seeking behavior [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the association between negative symptoms and hospitalization for schizophrenia has not yet been examined in a population-based sample.</p><p>Given the prevalence and functional impact of negative symptoms, it is important to further our knowledge on the prevalence of such symptoms in the general population, and their association with later mental disorders. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of negative symptoms in the general population and their association with psychotic experiences and with later hospitalization for schizophrenia, utilizing data from a population-based cohort of individuals assessed as young adults, and then followed for 24 years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The association between negative symptoms and subsequent psychiatric hospitalization was examined by merging data from an epidemiological study conducted in Israel in the 1980's with data from the National Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry. After receiving approval from the IRB at the Sheba Medical Center, these databases were linked in 2007 using the national identification number (analogous to the US Social Security number) as the linking variable. For subjects who participated in the epidemiological study and appeared in the hospitalization registry, dates of hospitalizations and discharge diagnoses were added to the file. Individuals who had a discharge diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20.0-F20.9) at any hospitalization were considered as clinically diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p><p>To preserve subjects' confidentiality, the national identification number was removed before the linked file was transferred to the investigators. Hence, patient records were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Epidemiological Study</title><p>This study utilized data from a two-stage epidemiological study of mental disorders among young adults in a 10-year birth cohort (1949&#x02013;1958) conducted in Israel in the 1980's [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As part of the original study&#x02019;s goal to compare the risk of selected disorders in socio-economically contrasting ethnic groups, a sample of 19,000 Israel-born individuals was drawn from the population registry and screened for father&#x02019;s continent of origin (North Africa or Europe) and level of education. This was done to balance socioeconomic status within advantaged and disadvantaged ethnic groups by over-sampling disadvantaged subjects from North African origin with high educational level and advantaged subjects of European origin with low educational level. Based on gender, education, ethnicity, and year of birth, 5,200 subjects were selected.</p><p>This cohort-based sample was screened and diagnosed for psychotic and other psychiatric disorders in two stages. During the screening stage, 94.5% (n = 4,914) were interviewed using a Hebrew version of the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview (PERI), a well validated screening tool [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Data were not obtained for 5.5% subjects (n = 286). Mean age at the time of the interview was 29.4 years (SD = 3.1 years); 49.6% were men. The PERI interview also included self-report of lifetime use of cannabis (including single or rare usage), coded 0 = no, 1 = yes.</p><p>Subjects reaching predetermined cut-off values on the PERI screening stage [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], unable to complete the screening interview, or suspected of having a history of psychiatric illness, were referred for a clinical diagnostic (second) stage (n = 2,643). In addition, to determine the rates of false negatives, 18.3% of the 2271 screened negatives&#x02014;who did not reach the predetermined cut-off values on the PERI&#x02014;were randomly selected and also referred for a diagnostic interview [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. From this sub-sample, 2,741 (90.8%) persons were interviewed by psychiatrists using a modified lifetime version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS-I; I for Israel) to arrive at a Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] diagnosis. The SADS-I also included an assessment of the best level of social functioning during the five years preceding the interview, rated on a scale of 1 (superior) to 7 (grossly inadequate). Mean time from the screening stage (PERI) to the second stage (SADS-I) was 1.1 years &#x000b1;11.5 months (range 0&#x02013;4.5 years).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Assessment of Negative Symptoms</title><p>Two of the study researchers (MW and NW) reviewed the symptoms covered in the PERI and identified items assessing negative symptoms similar to those assessed in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], scales commonly used for the assessment of negative symptoms. Fourteen symptoms (9 self-reported and 5 interviewer-rated; see <xref rid="pone.0119852.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) were identified. The self-report items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from (0) &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to (4) &#x0201c;very often&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not at all like you&#x0201d; (0) to &#x0201c;very much like you&#x0201d; (4), whereas the interviewer-rated items were scored &#x0201c;present&#x0201d; or absent&#x0201d;.</p><p>The fourteen negative symptoms were included in a principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Four symptom clusters were extracted in this analysis: avolition (4 items), social withdrawal (5 items), speech deficits (2 items), flat affect and poor hygiene (3 items) (<xref rid="pone.0119852.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

An additional 81 subjects (1.7%) were identified as having been hospitalized for non-psychotic disorders, including drug use, personality disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders and organic mental disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using the software package Stata, version 10 [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The data were weighted to estimate the rates of negative symptoms in the original population from which the cohort sample was drawn. This was done using Stata&#x02019;s tools for complex survey data analysis which incorporates the survey design characteristics (weighting, clustering, and stratification) into the data analysis to provide accurate point estimates and standard errors [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All numbers shown represent the actual number of subjects, whereas the percentages are weighted.</p><p>As the PERI was not designed to assess negative symptoms, we tested the construct validity of the negative symptoms identified by comparing the prevalence of these symptoms between people who were diagnosed with schizophrenia at the initial assessment in the epidemiological study in the 1980's (n = 24), those diagnosed with other definite RDC mental disorders (n = 1,624) and the rest of the sample.</p><p>First, in order to assess the effect of baseline reports of negative symptom on later hospitalization for schizophrenia, with no assumptions regarding the relative importance of the frequency at which the symptom was endorsed, we created for each subject a mean negative symptom score of the 9 self-report items (rated 0&#x02013;4). This mean score was then used in a logistic regression model to predict later hospitalization for schizophrenia.</p><p>Next, for purposes of analysis, each self-report item was dichotomized as present (indicating a score of 4) or absent (indicating a score of 0&#x02013;3), similar to the coding of the interviewer-rated items. We then examined the prevalence of negative symptoms in the population, as well as the prevalence of negative symptom clusters (avolition, social withdrawal, speech deficit, flat affect and poor hygiene). Next, a logistic regression analysis examining the presence of any negative symptom and risk of later hospitalization for schizophrenia was performed. To examine the specificity of negative symptoms as predictors of schizophrenia, risk of hospitalization for non-psychotic disorders was also tested. For all logistic regression models, the reference group was people who did not report any negative symptoms. Associations were expressed as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</p><p>Finally, we divided those with negative symptoms into sub-groups based on the co-occurrence of psychotic experiences (i.e, negative symptoms alone or negative symptoms and psychotic experiences together). We then estimated the interaction between psychotic experiences (coded as absent / weak / strong) and negative symptoms (coded as absent / present) in the model predicting hospitalization for schizophrenia, comparing multiplicative effect sizes (odds ratios) using the Stata test command.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Construct validity of negative symptom scale</title><p>The construct validity of the negative symptom scale was examined by comparing the prevalence of these 14 symptoms between 24 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia at the initial assessment in the epidemiological study, those diagnosed with other definite RDC mental disorders and the rest of the sample.

The prevalence found in this study is similar to that reported in a population-based study in Germany and in a study of American college students [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], finding that between 20&#x02013;22% of the general population had one or more negative symptoms. While negative symptoms are common in the general population, the vast majority of people with negative symptoms do not manifest a clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorder. This report adds to the existing literature as it is the first to examine the association between negative symptoms in the general population and hospital diagnoses of schizophrenia in a population-based sample, is based on a birth cohort and has the longest duration of follow-up.</p><p>Negative symptoms were more prevalent among males, subjects from North African origin, and those who were unmarried, unemployed and with fewer years of education. The prevalence of negative symptoms was higher among cannabis users and participants with poorer social functioning. This indicates that negative symptoms share some demographic patterns and risk factors with schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Overall, negative symptoms appeared to be associated with both later schizophrenia and, to a lesser degree, non-psychotic disorders. However, when examining the interaction between psychotic experiences and negative symptoms, the findings indicated that neither negative symptoms nor psychotic experiences alone predicted later schizophrenia. It was only the combined presence of both strong positive psychotic experiences and negative symptoms together that showed a statistically significant risk for later schizophrenia. Although the data in this report cannot speak to this possibility, it supports the notion presented by Moller [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that in the prodromal phase of the illness, negative symptoms begin worsening with the emergence of positive symptoms, leading to the initial acute psychotic episode. This was later confirmed in a longitudinal study on the topic reporting that transition from psychotic experiences to psychotic disorder is contingent on the earlier presence of negative symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations</title><p>The assessment of negative symptoms in this study was done using items that were not designed as a scale for the assessment of negative symptoms, and were not previously validated for this purpose. However, the present data analysis suggests that the symptoms examined were all more prevalent in people with schizophrenia, hence supporting the construct validity of most of these items. Additionally, not all negative symptoms were evaluated. For example, anhedonia or lack of emotional experience was not assessed as part of the epidemiological survey. Another potential limitation is that 9 of the 14 negative symptoms were based on self-report rather than on clinical observations.</p><p>The diagnoses of schizophrenia were drawn from a psychiatric hospitalization registry. Registry diagnoses are clinical, not research, diagnoses. However, they are assigned by board-certified psychiatrists who had the benefit of observing the patients throughout one or more hospitalizations and had been trained in the use of the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Studies that compared clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia assigned in state hospitals with research diagnoses have shown a high degree of concordance [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and a previous study by our group comparing registry diagnoses to RDC diagnoses found that the sensitivity of the registry diagnosis of non-affective psychotic disorders is 0.89, and of schizophrenia 0.87 [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>We are also limited by lack of data regarding emigrants. However, recent studies on schizophrenia and emigration argue against the possibility that patients more prone to schizophrenia are more likely to emigrate compared to those less prone to schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Finally, after removing subjects with diagnosable psychotic disorders at baseline, only 19 people with schizophrenia, the main outcome of interest, were included in the analytic sample. Hence, the regression models may be underpowered, resulting in large confidence intervals. For this reason, the inclusion of potential covariates in the models was not possible. As people whose psychotic illness had manifested prior to the baseline assessment (ages 25&#x02013;34) were removed from the analyses, and as the peak incidence for males and females is in the decade 15&#x02013;24 [<xref rid="pone.0119852.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the remaining participants are characterized by a later age of onset, which may limit the generalizability of these findings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119852.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Assessment of negative symptoms.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119852.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Itzhak Levav for his role in collecting the epidemiological data in the 1980's and for his contribution to this paper.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0119852.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Linscott</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>van Os</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>
