The disease is caused by auto-antibodies that bind to desmosomal cadherins desmoglein (Dsg) 3 or Dsg3 and Dsg1 in mucous membranes and skin. A currently unresolved controversy in PV is whether apoptosis is involved in the pathogenic process. The objective of this study was to perform preclinical studies to investigate apoptotic pathway activation in PV pathogenesis with the goal to assess its potential for clinical therapy. For this purpose, we investigated mouse and human skin keratinocyte cultures treated with PV antibodies (the experimental Dsg3 monospecific antibody AK23 or PV patients IgG), PV mouse models (passive transfer of AK23 or PVIgG into adult and neonatal mice) as well as PV patients&#x02019; biopsies (n=6). A combination of TUNEL assay, analyses of membrane integrity, early apoptotic markers such as cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and the collapse of actin cytoskeleton failed to provide evidence for apoptosis in PV pathogenesis. However, the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> PV models, allowing to monitor progression of lesion formation, revealed an early, transient and low-level caspase-3 activation. Pharmacological inhibition confirmed the functional implication of caspase-3 in major events in PV such as shedding of Dsg3, keratin retraction, proliferation including c-Myc induction, p38MAPK activation and acantholysis. Together, these data identify low-level caspase-3 activation downstream of disrupted Dsg3 trans- or cis-adhesion as a major event in PV pathogenesis that is non-synonymous with apoptosis and represents, unlike apoptotic components, a promising target for clinical therapy. At a broader level, these results posit that an impairment of adhesive functions in concert with low-level, non-lethal caspase-3 activation can evoke profound cellular changes which may be of relevance for other diseases including cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support for CL, BS and AG from &#x02018;&#x02018;Coordination Theme I (Health) of the European Community&#x02019;s FP7, grant agreement number HEALTH-F2-2008-200515&#x02019;&#x02019;, for CL, BS, KS also from the Swiss National Science Foundation grant 31003A_135689 and the Martha Stiftung Z&#x000fc;rich and for KS from the Novartis Research Fund, Basel, Switzerland.

It characteristically manifests as loss of intercellular adhesion (acantholysis) between basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, where desmoglein 3 (Dsg3), the major antigenic target in PV, is most abundantly expressed [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dsg1 can compensate for loss of Dsg3 function in the epidermis [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; accordingly, in PV patients and mouse models, Dsg3 antibodies alone predominantly induce clinical blisters in hair follicles and mucous membranes whereas combined Dsg3 and Dsg1 antibodies concomitantly evoke epidermal blisters [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Dsg3 and Dsg1 are desmosomal cadherins and adhesive components of desmosomes. These robust intercellular adhesion structures confer mechanical resistance to a variety of tissues including skin. Despite their robustness, desmosomes are highly dynamic and alterations in desmosomal cadherin expression and composition are pivotal during embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis and repair [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, in response to injury, epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation or UV irradiation, mechanisms such as reversion from high to low affinity adhesive states of desmosomes [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], desmosomal cadherin endocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and proteolytic shedding implicating consecutively caspase-3 and metalloproteases [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have been described. Caspase activation was long considered an exclusive hallmark of apoptosis and hence, desmosomal remodeling has often been linked to apoptotic cell death. However, according to the recommendations of cell death classification, caspase activation alone is not sufficient to evoke apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] because caspases, as a paradox to cell death, have been involved in proliferation, differentiation and cellular remodeling of a variety of cell types [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is in line with delayed keratinocyte differentiation in caspase-3 mutant mouse embryos [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Accordingly, depending on its level of activation, caspase-3 has been proposed as a &#x0201c;stress intensity sensor&#x0201d; acting as a switch between cell survival and death [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In PV, Dsg3 antibody binding directly interferes with cis- or trans-adhesion between Dsg3 molecules [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] thereby eliciting cellular response signals which were found to be responsible for the ultimate loss of desmosome structure and function. Specifically, pathogenic signals have been involved in re-organization and endocytosis of Dsg3 as well as a change in keratinocyte fate from differentiation to proliferation as proven by application of pharmacologic inhibitors or the use of knock-out models [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on the initial observation of TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling)-positive cells in lesional skin of PV patients [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], apoptosis was also proposed to be involved in PV pathogenesis. Independent reports on caspase activation in the neonatal PV mouse model and reduced blistering after caspase-3 inhibitor treatment supported this claim [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Accordingly, &#x0201c;acantholysis and apoptosis&#x0201d; were discussed to be &#x0201c;inseparable in PV&#x0201d;, invoking a process termed &#x0201c;apoptolysis&#x0201d; where acantholysis proceeds along apoptotic pathways resulting in cell death [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Inhibition of apoptotic pathway components including FasL was therefore suggested as potential therapy for PV patients [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, doubts have been cast on the involvement of apoptosis, primarily because two independent studies failed to reveal TUNEL positive cells or apoptotic cell morphology by electron microscopy in systematic surveys of PVIgG-treated cultured HaCat keratinocytes and skin explants as well as PV patients&#x02019; skin biopsies [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, apoptotic cell death, caspase-3 activation and nuclear accumulation of cleaved PARP were either not detected or suggested to occur after loss of adhesion. This led to the conclusion that if happening, these late events are not taking part in the acantholytic process [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although the two previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] appeared to make a strong point against apoptosis in PV, they did not resolve the conundrum that a range of caspase-3 inhibitors was able to reduce blistering in the neonatal PV mouse model.</p><p>A variety of caspase inhibitors have been developed, some of which are in Phase I/II clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although these inhibitors do represent a promising adjunctive treatment option or a second line intervention for PV patients, their testing in PV clinical trials are not justified unless experimental proof of concept and the mechanisms of action of caspase-3 in PV are resolved. This prompted us to specifically evaluate the involvement of apoptosis in correlation with caspase-3 activation in PV. Here we used a combination of cultured keratinocytes, established PV mouse models [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and previously used biopsies from PV patients [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to firstly investigate the occurrence of apoptosis and secondly, in the same PV models, caspase-3 activation and the consequences of caspase-3 inhibition in response to the Dsg3-specific pathogenic antibody AK23 [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or purified PVIgG.</p><p>Our data corroborate that acantholysis in PV occurs without implicating apoptosis. However, an early, transient and low-level caspase-3 activation was revealed downstream of disrupted Dsg3 cis-or trans-adhesion [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which, as demonstrated by the use of pharmacological pan-caspase and caspase-3 inhibitors, functionally contributes to major pathological events in the acantholytic process. Our results support that caspase-3 is activated without triggering apoptosis but instead is an important component in the early events leading to PV blistering, thus representing a promising therapeutic target in PV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Keratinocyte cultures and inhibitor treatment</title><p>Mouse keratinocytes were isolated form E18.5 old C57BL/6J embryos (purchased from Central Animal Facility, University of Bern), sacrificed by decapitation and cells grown in CnT-02 medium (CELLnTEC Advanced Cell Systems AG, Bern Switzerland) and characterized as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

Positive cells at the level of sebaceous glands and stratum granulosum, present in both control and AK23-treated biopsies, served as internal positive control.

As a primary outcome, these preclinical studies provide the basis to justify Phase I clinical trials for PV patients involving caspase-3 inhibitors and, secondly, may resolve the conundrum of apoptosis in PV.</p><p>Initial evidence in support of apoptosis in PV was based on two reports of TUNEL-positive cells in lesions of PV patients [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Loss of intercellular adhesion or acantholysis in PV undeniably evokes an aspect of apoptosis, which is the reduction of the cellular volume termed cell &#x0201c;shrinkage&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, as recommended by the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], other morphological criteria, in particular chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation have to occur to confirm apoptosis. A recent survey of four PV patient&#x02019;s biopsies using electron microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] as well as our analyses by Hoechst 33258 staining in cultured keratincoytes, PV mouse models and PV patient&#x02019;s biopsies (<xref rid="pone.0119809.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) now provide strong evidence that these typical morphological signs of apoptosis are not commonly seen in PV. Furthermore, the screen of all currently available experimental PV models as well as patients biopsies for TUNEL positive cells in concert with membrane and cellular integrity or apoptosis-related enzymological changes, done here and in part also in two other studies [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], did also not hint at a consistent cellular change in progression to the requested &#x0201c;point-of-no-return&#x0201d; featuring cell death. The occasional rather than systematic occurrence of TUNEL positive PV lesions, observed here and in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggests that secondary conditions, which are unrelated to the mechanism of lesion formation <italic>sensu strictu</italic> may favor cell death in acantholytic cells.

Incidentally, however, EFGR represents a survival factor in case of loss of adhesion in keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and these cells are resistant to the c-Myc-induced apoptosis seen in other cell types [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The major arguments brought forward in support of apoptosis or activation of apoptotic pathways in PV was, however, the direct and in particular indirect evidence (by use of caspase inhibitors preventing loss of adhesion) for caspase activation [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].

These seemingly controversial data can now be explained by the findings described in this study. Our data confirm absence of robust caspase-3 activation before, during and after blister formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0119809.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119809.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). They instead revealed low-level caspase-3 activation, which occurs in a transient manner <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and functionally contributes to PV pathogenesis as demonstrated by pharmacological caspase-3 inhibition ameliorating blistering. By revealing low-level caspase-3 activation in the same models which failed to exhibit apoptotic pathway activation, these results now allow us to propose a paradigm shift; pathological caspase-3 activation occurs in PV but is of low-level and uncoupled from apoptosis and classical apoptotic pathways involving initiator caspases-8, -9 and -12 (as blocking the initiator caspase-8, -9 and -12 did not prevent loss of intercellular adhesion).</p><p>A role of caspases independent of apoptosis has been appreciated for many years [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As a paradox to apoptosis, caspase-3 has in particular been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration and differentiation when activated in a transient manner and at low-levels [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. For example, caspase-3 but not caspases-1, -6, -7, -8, -9, or -10 was found to be required &#x0201c;periodically&#x0201d; in pre-mitotic HeLa cells without inducing apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Reminiscent of our own findings, the authors of the study on HeLa cells further discussed that the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic functions relies on the intensity (high versus low) and duration of caspase-3 activation. In support of their claims, transient low-level caspase-3 activation in early antigen-driven CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation correlated with proliferation but not with cell death [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Consistently, in PV mouse models and patients epidermis, enhanced proliferation in concert with increased c-Myc and cyclin D1 have been observed [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a role of caspase-3 in supporting proliferation in PV is suggested here by the reduction of some of these pro-proliferative mediators in response to caspase-3 inhibitor treatment.</p><p>In T cells with non-apoptotic caspase-3 activation, this enzyme was found to primarily associate with the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Based on the knowledge that executioner caspases such as caspase-3 must enter the nucleus to trigger apoptosis, this conveys that the subcellular localization of caspase-3 may also impact on its apoptotic activity. A non-apoptotic function of caspase-3 at the plasma membrane, as suggested by our results on Dsg3 shedding, may involve the cleavage of molecules implicated in intercellular adhesion and remodeling of desmosomes. Desmosomal cadherins in addition to the plaque proteins plakoglobin, plakophilin and desmoplakin were indeed found to represent intracellular substrates for caspase-3 during desmosome remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, caspase-3-cleaved Dsg3 serves as a substrate for extracellular metalloproteases resulting in shedding of Dsg3 from the surface [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Shed Dsg3, as observed here in PV but to some extent also in differentiating keratinocytes, might interfere through competition with transadhering Dsg3 to enhance loss of adhesion in PV or remodel adhesion during keratinocyte differentiation, respectively.</p><p>With regards to potential pathways activating low-level, non-apoptotic caspase-3, TRAIL-induced TNF receptor activation was found to have this ability in the context of normal human keratinocytes differentiation further implicating p38MAPK [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Remarkably, p38MAPK activation has been involved in PV pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and its decrease by caspase-3 inhibition, shown here in the PV mouse model, stipulates that p38MAPK could, like cyclins, c-Myc and N-Myc, be dependent on caspase-3 activation in PV. Another candidate which may potentially cooperate with and in particular induce caspase-3 activation in keratinocytes under stress is EGFR, which is activated in our PV mouse models [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In mouse and human, caspase-3 can be directly activated through effectors such as granzyme B [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] which depends on EGFR signaling as described in sub-lethally UV-B irradiated keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>A particularly interesting role of caspase-3 in cell survival rather than cell death has recently been described in response to mild cellular stress [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Low-level caspase-3 differentially cleaves p120 RasGAP resulting in activation of the survival pathway Akt and an anti-apoptotic feedback loop preventing robust caspase-3 activation. The initiation of an anti-apoptotic stress response upon antibody binding to Dsg3 may be supported by the increase in heat shock protein 27 (hsp27) downstream of p38MAPK, which was described in human PV patients skin and cultured keratinocytes treated with PVIgG or cloned PV patients&#x02019; antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Hsp27 is mostly anti-apoptotic; it maintains redox homeostasis, mitochondria stability and can block cytochrome c release. At the same time it prevents robust caspase-3 activation and initiates survival pathways such as Akt to repair cellular damage [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. As discussed above, a potential interdependence between caspase-3 and p38MAPK is suggested in our study by caspase-3 inhibitor treatment. This interdependence is also compatible with their time frame of activation; both effectors are both activated early after disruption of Dsg3 adhesion. Furthermore, p38MAPK inhibitor-treated mice injected with PVIgG [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] as well as caspase-3 inhibitor treatment, shown here, prevent key pathological events and ameliorate blistering. It is therefore conceivable that subsequent to disrupted Dsg3 trans- or cis-adhesion and pathological signal activation involving caspase-3, a cellular response aiming at cell survival and repair is mounted in PV. Cell survival and repair, as opposed to apoptosis and clearance of damaged cells is supported by the hair follicle phenotype of Dsg3-/- mice, in which blisters in the resting hair follicle resolve allowing for hair regrowth in anagen [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similarly, in the 8-week-old mice injected with AK23 used here, hair follicle lesions are repaired without exhibiting apoptosis and cell-cell contact is re-established prior to the next anagen entry (Schulze et al, unpublished). Potential repair mechanisms in PV have so far not been addressed and warrant further investigation.</p><p>A particularly interesting study was published during the revision of this manuscript. Using atomic force microscopy, the authors showed that pathogenic single-chain PV antibodies irreversibly alter the stiffness of HaCaT cells implicating caspases (as shown by a pan-caspase inhibitor) but not FasL [<xref rid="pone.0119809.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Although caspase activation was addressed as an apoptotic pathway mediator, both our studies are in agreement that apoptotic cell death is not involved in PV pathogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our results support a new model in which PV antibody binding triggers a cellular signaling response implicating early transient, low-level caspase-3 activation. This activity is uncoupled from apoptosis and engages a variety of cellular processes preceding acantholysis such as remodeling of Dsg3 adhesion via proteolytic cleavage and the reorganization of the keratin network. This scenario is ideally suited to propose caspase-3 as an adjunctive target to reduce blistering in PV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119809.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Dissociation assays in AK23-treated mouse and human keratinocytes and actin remodeling in PVIgG-treated mouse keratinocytes.</title><p>(A-B) Dissociation assays: Graphs depict the number of fragments larger than 0.1 mm<sup>2</sup> generated after AK23 treatment and application of mechanical stress of A, C57BL/6J mouse keratinocytes at 48 hours, (n = 3/group in duplicates); note that 20 &#x003bc;g/ml AK23 treatment for 48 hours was chosen as standard condition as illustrated in the right panel; B, primary human foreskin keratinocytes, with 80 &#x003bc;g/ml AK23 for 24 hours set as standard.
