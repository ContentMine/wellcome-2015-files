We therefore took up the present study to explore if the leishmanial lipid (pLLD) isolated from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> can play an anti-neoplastic role in acute myeloid leukemia cells by regulating cellular growth. Indeed pLLD significantly inhibited cell proliferation of four AML cell lines (HL-60, MOLT-4, U937, and K562). Scanning electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that it significantly induced apoptosis of U937 cells through morphological alteration. Occurrence of apoptosis was checked by using Annexin exposure and this established that the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase in time-dependent manner. pLLD increased the intracellular ROS with alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, as detected using DCFDA. It also regulated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins like Bax, Bcl2, Bad and t-Bid besides causing cleavage of PARP as determined by western blot analysis. Treatment of U937 cells with pLLD induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, p38, and caspases 9/3. The results suggest that pLLD induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells possibly via increasing intracellular ROS and regulating the MAPK pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The CSIR and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR; India) financially supported this work.

Specifically, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a myeloid line of blood cells characterised by the failure to differentiate and by over proliferation in the stem cell compartment, leads to accumulation of non-functional myeloblast cells [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120509.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Treatment by chemotherapeutic exposure may even increase the chances of subsequently developing AML; the risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conventional therapy of AML is a combination of debilitating radiation exposure and bone marrow transplantation that induces complete remission in only 50% of patients with recovery rate of 30%. Moreover, these chemotherapeutic agents can also affect the health of normal cells causing unpleasant side effects such as anemia, bleeding, and infection [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, these strategies have not proven to be altogether satisfactory.</p><p>New approaches for leukemia treatment are therefore essential, and this may be brought about by promoting differentiation or triggering apoptotic death in leukemic cells. Apoptosis is a biochemical process with structural alteration and can be induced by chemotherapeutic agents mostly via mitochondrial apoptotic pathways [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120509.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The release of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins affects cellular ionic imbalance. This initiates cytochrome c release and leads to activation of caspase-9, which in turn triggers the signaling cascade causing caspase-dependent DNA fragmentation. Thus, the involvement of several pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax, Bak, Bad) or anti-apoptotic (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) molecules regulate the mitochondrial membrane permeability in apoptosis under the stimulation of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Bcl-2 family members act as important prognostic factors in AML; the inhibition of Bcl-2 expression induces apoptosis and sensitizes AML cells to chemotherapy via regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, a key integration point in the signaling cascade regulated by growth factor receptors. Constitutive regulation of the MAPK signaling and related cascade may drive the oncogenic transformation of normal blast cells and is commonly detected in myeloid leukemia resulting from a variety of genetic alterations recognized to be responsive against AML [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Natural products that may even come from microbial sources have gained increasing importance for potential use in intervention against malignant neoplastic diseases. One such example involves the use of live, attenuated bacteria or their metabolites and cellular components to improve the therapeutic efficacy. Often anerobic bacteria mediated therapy or use of several bacterial products like LPS or ceramide(s) potentially induce apoptosis in malignant cells [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120509.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interestingly, a lipid molecule isolated from a fungus has shown its therapeutic efficacy in multiple sclerosis and neoplasia [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previously, we reported that the lipid from the avirulent strain of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>donovani</italic> plays a potential role in arthritis patients to control the inflammatory response [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Very recently, we have also explored the bio-activity of virulent leishmanial lipid (pLLD) in protection against sepsis associated inflammatory injury [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This interesting outcome encouraged us to reveal the therapeutic efficacy of microbes and their metabolites, in particular the leishmanial lipid (pLLD). Herein we disclose a new therapeutic role of pLLD to induce apoptosis in AML cells following the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway of activation of caspases and MAPK signaling proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Material</title><p>MTT and DMSO were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

For investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms, we therefore employed western blot analysis to determine whether MAPKs were activated in pLLD-treated U937 cells. The results showed that ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK levels were altered. The treatment of U937 cells with pLLD (150 &#x003bc;g/ml) also resulted in a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK (<xref rid="pone.0120509.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120509.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.).

Earlier, we have reported the bio-activity of the leishmanial lipid in protecting against sepsis associated inflammatory injury [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lipids are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cell membranes that play diverse physiological roles in mammalian cells such as in cell differentiation, proliferation and/or receptor mediated endocytosis. Importantly, they have been shown to constitute a messenger system that plays a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis via activation of cellular signal transduction systems [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These interesting findings inspired us to find out a novel entity from microbial source by exploring the biological potency of the leishmanial lipid for the regression of cancer cell growth in AML.</p><p>AML is a progressive non-solid tumorigenesis event with high mortality rates, for which novel strategies are needed to improve the current scenario [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our studies demonstrated that pLLD concentration-dependently inhibited cell proliferation in four human leukemic cell lines, viz. U937, HL-60, K562 and MOLT-4. Cell proliferation is governed by Annexin exposure and cell cycle, apoptosis such as significant increases in chromatin condensation, that is a complex and stepwise process, and uncontrolled cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We have performed the cytotoxicity assay to observe that 150 &#x003bc;g/ml of pLLD causes minimal viability in U937 cells at 24 h. Apoptotic like morphological and nuclear changes were also effected in pLLD treated U937 cells in time dependent manner. This was supported by the enhancement of phosphatidyl serine externalization which belongs to apoptotic events and increases apoptotic DNA cleavage with G1/G0 phase arrest. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found similar apoptotic like alterations including blebbing and swelling in treated U937 cells.</p><p>Apoptosis is mediated by proteolytic enzymes called caspases, which trigger cell death by cleaving specific proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The activation process is initiated by extracellular or intracellular death signals which cause intracellular adaptor molecules to aggregate, generate ROS, and activate pro-caspases and then caspases [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Caspases 9 and 3 are believed to play crucial roles in mediating mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis pathway [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The present results suggest that pLLD might have acted through the initiator caspase-9 and then through the executioner caspase-3 to increase the cleavage form of PARP to induce AML cell apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of caspases 9 and 3 with Z-LEHD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK generally decreased the growth inhibitory potential of pLLD. Intracellular GSH depletion is an early hallmark in the progression of cell death in response to different apoptotic stimuli. As GSH is one of the prime antioxidant within the cells, that GSH regulates apoptosis by preventing the accumulation of ROS. Here, we represented that pLLD radically enhanced the depletion of intracellular GSH from leukemic cells directing to generation of ROS. The study indicates that pLLD initiated apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.</p><p>During mitochondria dysfunction, the mitochondrial permeability potential (MMP) alters and cytochrome c is released from mitochondria to cytosol [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The opening of MMP is controlled by the Bcl-2 family members. Bcl-2 is present in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it functions to suppress apoptosis via blocking cytochrome c release and binding to Apaf-1. In the presence of excess Bax, Bcl-2 is displaced from Apaf-1, which may promote apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120509.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein occurred in the AML cell line U937 after treatment with pLLD, which caused MMP loss and cyt c leak out.</p><p>Based on the ability of the signaling cascade to lower the apoptotic threshold, regulation of the MAPK module has been proposed as a novel approach to treat leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as it increases the sensitivity to various apoptotic stimuli, such as DNA-damaging agents, with alteration of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic activity at a post-translational level for cellular growth and survival [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Several studies show that the ERK1/2 pathway possesses anti-apoptotic functions [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120509.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], primarily due to the increased activation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. On the other hand, JNKs are indispensable for apoptosis and appear to ensure pro-apoptotic signaling by phosphorylating Bam and Bmf, activating Bax to initiate apoptosis, and phosphorylating Bcl-2 both in vitro and in intact cells [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The signaling of p38 MAPK causes rapid inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway and negatively regulates JNK activity. The phosphorylated p38 can also activate a wide range of substrates that are generated by these phosphorylation events [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our previous report has shown that MAPKs can be induced via pLLD mediated anti-inflammatory responses. Thus, the evidence presented here suggests that pLLD up-regulates phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38, and decreases the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in leukemic cells. Thus, pLLD may induce apoptosis of the acute myeloid leukemia cells via increase of intracellular ROS, activation of the p38 pathways, and inhibition of expression of the downstream mediator Bcl-2 [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>AP-1, a transcriptional factor consisting of the dimers of members of the Jun families of proteins, appears to be responsible for apoptosis in leukemic cells. MAPKs share several upstream regulators and are involved in the regulation of transcription factors including AP-1 to induce biological changes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Thus, treatment of U937 cells with pLLD caused transient activation of AP-1, that is often regulated by Bcl2 [<xref rid="pone.0120509.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this study indicates that pathogenic leishmanial lipid (pLLD) could have potential growth regulatory role in acute myeloid leukemia cells via inducing apoptosis. It stimulates the activation of caspases 3 and 9 with generation of ROS and alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential. This eventually results in the cleavage of PARP in U937 cells. It also moderately activates the pro and anti apoptotic proteins in leukemic cells. Interestingly, it activates the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK, and inhibits the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bid. Thus pLLD may prove to be a useful candidate for chemotherapy against AML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120509.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Growth inhibitory effect of pLLD on different cancer cells including (A) A375, MCF-7, A549, PC and (B) normal blood peripheral mononuclear cells at different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 150, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml) at 24 h; viability was measured by MTT assay.</title><p>Data represent mean &#x000b1; SEM of three experiments (** p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120509.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120509.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of pLLD potentiates on intracellular GSH in U937 cells.</title><p>U937 cells were treated as indicated for measurement of intracellular GSH as described in Materials and Methods.
