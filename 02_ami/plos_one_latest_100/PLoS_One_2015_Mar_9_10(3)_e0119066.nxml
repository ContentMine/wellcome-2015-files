Previous studies focused on the biology of chimeric transcription factors formed due to this translocation. However, the physiological consequences of heterozygous EWSR1 loss in these tumors have largely remained elusive. Previously, we have identified various mRNAs bound to EWS using PAR-CLIP. In this study, we demonstrate CCDC6, a known cell cycle regulator protein, as a novel target regulated by EWS. siRNA mediated down regulation of EWS caused an elevated apoptosis in cells in a CCDC6-dependant manner. This effect was rescued upon re-expression of CCDC6. This study provides evidence for a novel functional link through which wild-type EWS operates in a target-dependant manner in Ewing sarcoma.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a &#x0201c;Forschungsstipendium der Vereinigung rheinisch-westf&#x000e4;lischer Kinder- und Jugend&#x000e4;rzte und Kinderchirurgen&#x0201d; fellowship and Elterninitiative Kinderkrebsklinik e.V.

Genetically, 90% of these tumors are characterized by a translocation whereby the N-terminal portion of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) EWSR1 is joined to a DNA-binding protein belonging to the ETS family of transcription factors (e.g. FLI1, ERG, and ETV1) (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Additionally, EWSR1 fusions to ATF1 cause soft tissue clear cell sarcoma while fusions to CHOP cause myxoid liposarcoma [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Considering that the resulting chimeric transcription factors such as EWS-FLI are under the control of the strong FET promoter, they are expressed at high levels in the cell and generally believed to be the main cause of malignant transformation. Additionally, the loss of the EWSR1 allele creates haploinsufficiency of EWS protein which affects its RNA-binding activity and also its mRNA targets suggesting that EWS and its targets have important roles in the development of disease [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has also been shown that EWS/FL1 alone is not sufficient to induce sarcomagenesis in a transgenic mouse model suggesting that factors unrelated to the aberrant transcription factors also contribute to the development of Ewing sarcoma family tumours (ESFT) [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0119066.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0119066.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Regulation of targets by EWS in vivo.</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

It belongs to the FET family of RBPs which includes <underline>F</underline>US, <underline>E</underline>WS and <underline>T</underline>AF15. These proteins bind to RNA and DNA and are implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cellular signalling. Altered protein expression of these ubiquitously expressed proteins has been shown to cause various human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] EWS affects cellular growth mechanism like proliferation, migration and invasion by regulating AKT substrate PRAS40 [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and FAS dependent apoptosis by regulating the exon skipping of FAS/CD90 [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EWS plays a major role in mitosis during spindle formation by regulating Aurora B kinase [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Together, EWS showcases a promising role in several cell survival pathways.</p><p>To get a deeper insight into the physiological function of EWS, PAR-CLIP (Photo Activatable Ribonucleoside-enhanced CrossLinking and Immuno-Precipitation), a technique to study the RNA interactome of any RBP of interest [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], was previously applied to EWS revealing its transcriptome-wide RNA targets [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using PAR-CLIP combined with stringent bioinformatic quality criteria we could show that the mRNAs of 4488 genes were directly bound by EWS. We now sought to further investigate the regulated among the many bound targets to uncover the physiological function of EWS. We further identified 116 genes whose expression altered upon EWS down regulation and show that a cell cycle regulator CCDC6 is regulated by EWS by binding to its 3&#x02019;untranslated region (3&#x02019;UTR).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>For culture conditions of T-REx HEK293 Flp-In cells (Invitrogen), HEK293T cells and cells stably expressing FLAG/HA-tagged EWS please see [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

HEK293T cells which were treated with siRNA targeting EWS showed clear reduction in the expression of CBFB, CCDC6, MDM2 and FGF9 (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Downregulation of these genes could further have an effect on genes they regulate and signaling pathways they are involved in. For example, MDM2 is a protein which inhibits activation of p53 [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], any downregulation in the levels of MDM2 disturbs the functional interactions of these networks which further affects tissue homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] such as the notch induced p53 activity [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Another target, FGF9, which was reported to be downregulated and mutated in several carcinomas plays an important role in activating FGFR signaling. This signaling pathway plays a role in differentiation and inhibits growth thus acting as a tumor suppressor. Therefore its downregulation upon EWS knockdown could repress its tumor suppressor activity [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, CBFB is also frequently mutated in AML and is known to play a role in hematopoietic development [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The genes regulated by CBFB are important in chromatin deacetylation and promoter methylation and thus playing a role in gene transcriptional activation or repression. Therefore its downregulation could disrupt the normal pathways in hematopoiesis and also effect gene regulation. Future experiments are necessary to study in detail the interactions of EWS with these genes and the complex pathways they regulate.</p><p>Since ectopic expression of EWS/FLI1 resulted in growth arrest and apoptosis rather than promoting cellular transformation in cells [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as well as in mice [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we next sought to look at the genes regulated by EWS with roles in cellular proliferation, cell cycle and cell death. Several of the EWS up-regulated targets and down-regulated targets had roles in cell cycle and G1/S transition like SKP2 (p45), BCAT1, CCDC6, CUL2, PPP1CB, RHOU etc. Genes with roles in proliferation and cell death included DNAJA2, MDM2, NOP2, FGF9, ID2 etc. Others like AEN, APTX, TOP2A and UBE3E had roles in DNA damage response. We further narrowed down our focus onto CCDC6, Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 6 gene since it showed high fold change in the microarray analysis and a high number of PAR-CLIP clusters. CCDC6 is also known to have several cell cycle associated functions including DNA damage response [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], cell cycle regulation by controlling the intra-S-Phase and G2/M checkpoints. Knockdown of CCDC6 also showed increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>CCDC6 is regulated by EWS on RNA and protein level</title><p>CCDC6 is a ubiquitously expressed protein which is downregulated in several cancers and predicted to be a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is known to be frequently rearranged with RET protein in papillary thyroid carcinomas [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119066.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and fuses to platelet derived growth factor receptor beta gene causing atypical chronic myeloid leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>RNA-binding proteins are known to regulate gene expression via post transcriptional mechanisms by stabilizing the mRNA they bind to. We wanted to explore whether EWS stabilizes CCDC6 by binding to it. We performed mRNA stability assay by treating the cells with Actinomycin D to inhibit de novo RNA synthesis and found that the half-life of CCDC6 was ~4.1 h in control cells, whereas in cells treated with EWS siRNA the half-life decreased to ~3.2 h. Together, these data suggest that EWS stabilizes CCDC6 transcript (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>We also performed luciferase assays to confirm the regulation of CCDC6 mRNA by EWS protein. We cloned the mRNA target sequence carrying the PAR-CLIP clusters downstream of the 3&#x02019;UTR of Renilla luciferase, and used firefly luciferase as an internal control in psiCHECK-2 plasmid. Upon co-transfection of both plasmids we observed an increase of luciferase activity compared to the empty vector control due to the increase in the expression of CCDC6 UTR (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). We then performed the luciferase assays with different doses of EWS and a clear dose-dependent effect was observed which further confirmed the specificity of EWS mediated regulation of CCDC6 (<xref rid="pone.0119066.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>.).</p><p>For our further experiments, we chose MHH-ES-1, a Ewing sarcoma cell line which carries the most frequently occurring translocation EWS-FLI. qRT-PCR results showed downregulation of CCDC6 mRNA levels upon knockdown of EWS. The siRNA is designed to target the c-terminal region of EWSR1 which is absent in EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript in MHH-ES-1 (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The same effect was also observed in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="pone.0119066.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>.). Also, Western blot showed decreased expression of CCDC6 protein upon EWS knockdown in MHH-ES-1 (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and also in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="pone.0119066.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>.) thus showing that the regulation of CCDC6 by EWS extends to the protein level. Since this regulation might further have an impact on several other downstream genes that CCDC6 itself regulates, we tested one of these published targets, namely FBXW7, which is required for DNA damage response [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and indeed, qRT-PCR on FBXW7 following knockdown of EWS showed reduced RNA levels (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Since FBXW7 is mutated in several cancers and shown to be a tumor suppressor, the pathway through which all these proteins inter-regulate might further play a role in sarcomagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

To address whether this mechanism might also lessen the effects of EWS haploinsufficiency in Ewing sarcoma, we measured FUS and TAF15 mRNA levels upon EWS knockdown in MHH-ES-1 cells. However, there was no increase in mRNA levels for either of the two genes (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This indicates that, probably due to a different cellular context, in Ewing sarcoma there is no rescue mechanism for loss of EWS expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Downregulation of EWS affects viability, proliferation and cell cycle</title><p>Gene set enrichment analysis and DAVID analysis revealed that several targets regulated by EWS play a role in regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle. Also, EWS was reported to maintain mitotic integrity and proneural cell survival in zebra fish by regulating aurora B [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Earlier studies reported that CCDC6 silencing increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation and affected cell cycle division by controlling the intra S phase and G2/M checkpoints [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TAF15, another member of the FET family of proteins was also shown to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>To confirm whether downregulation of EWS also affects those processes, we assessed apoptosis using Annexin V FITC and PI double staining of EWS knockdown and control HEK293T cells. We recorded an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in EWS siRNA treated cells (63% living cells, 27% apoptotic and 10% necrotic cells) compared to controls (74% living, 13% apoptotic and 13% necrotic cells) (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) while the % necrotic cells remained unchanged. We also confirmed increased cell death using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay by counting the cell number of dead and vital cells on three consecutive days (data not shown). These results further confirmed the previous finding that EWS knockdown induces apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We next performed gain of function experiments to see if up regulation of CCDC6 after EWS knockdown will rescue this phenotype. To do this, we co-transfected the cells with EWS siRNA and CCDC6 overexpression vector and found that the apoptotic rate were 14% less in CCDC6 overexpressed cells compared to empty vector (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), confirming that overexpression of CCDC6 upon EWS knockdown indeed rescued the observed phenotype.</p><p>Apoptotic signals are coupled to growth regulatory processes such as proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and cellular differentiation. Therefore to examine if the observed apoptosis affected the proliferation rate of the cells, we measured the proliferation of EWS knockdown and control cells using CCK8 assay. We indeed noticed that the proliferation rate was remarkably declined upon downregulation of EWS compared to those transfected with no siRNA transfection and scrambled siRNA transfection (<xref rid="pone.0119066.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p>Given that EWS regulates the expression of CCDC6, and that EWS downregulation induces apoptosis, and CCDC6 has been implicated in apoptosis coupled to S and G2/M phase cell cycle defects, we next tested cell cycle progression of the cells by propidium iodide staining after 48 hours of transfection. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0119066.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, we observed a decrease of cells in S and G2/M phase upon EWS knockdown and an increased cell number with a sub G0/G1 DNA content typical of apoptotic cells. This indicated increased apoptosis of cells that had passed the G1 checkpoint. Higher apoptotic rate might have likely affected the duration of cell cycle or the doubling time of the cells. The observed decrease of cell number in S and G2/M phase might be due to the fact that CCDC6 regulates cell cycle checkpoints like 14&#x02013;3&#x02013;3&#x003c3; and CDC25C [<xref rid="pone.0119066.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which are important for S phase duration, transition into G2 phase and activation of mitosis. Cell cycle checkpoints safeguard the cells from accumulating genetic errors and any deregulation will prepare the ground for increased mutagenesis and onset of several cancers. Therefore the aberrant entrance of cells into next phases by skipping the checkpoint controls regulated by CCDC6 might further triggers unwanted mutations leading to genetic aberrations.</p><p>Taken together our results demonstrate that EWS controls apoptosis and cell cycle progression by regulating one of its key mRNA target CCDC6. EWS therefore regulates a wide range of cellular processes to ensure genome integrity and cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have unveiled new roles of EWS in gene regulation and RNA metabolism. This suggests that highly complex roles are played by EWS and a thorough elucidation of the entire mRNA target network of native EWS is essential in understanding the molecular and cellular biology of Ewing sarcoma. Future studies will show whether EWS and/or its target mRNAs will offer new therapeutic approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119066.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Location of siRNA on EWS (A)</bold>.
