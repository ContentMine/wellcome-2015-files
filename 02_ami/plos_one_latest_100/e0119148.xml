However, the molecular mechanisms of S1P regulated migration of papillary thyroid cancer cells are still unknown. In this study, we showed that S1P induced PTK6 mRNA and protein expression in two thyroid follicular cancer cell lines (ML-1 and FTC-133). Further studies demonstrated that induced PTK6 and its downstream signal component (ERK1/2) are involved in S1P-induced migration. Upon investigating the mechanisms behind this event, we found that miR-17 inhibited the expression of PTK6 through direct binding to its 3&#x02019;-UTR. Through overexpression and knockdown studies, we found that miR-17 can significantly inhibit S1P-induced migration in thyroid follicular cancer cells. Interestingly, overexpression or knockdown of PTK6 or ERK1/2 effectively removed the inhibition of S1P-induced migration by miR-17. Furthermore, we showed that S1P decreased miR-17 expression levels. Meanwhile, in papillary thyroid cancers, miR-17 is downregulated and negatively associated with clinical staging, whereas PTK6 is upregulated and positively associated with clinical stages. Collectively, our work defines a novel signaling pathway implicated in the control of thyroid cancer migration.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Social Development Research Plan of the Liaoning Province Science and Technology Department (Grant No.2010225034).

We determined that S1P inhibits miR-17 expression and induces PTK6 expression. Further, studies showed that miR-17 inhibits S1P induced migration of thyroid follicular carcinoma cells by targeting PTK6 and inhibiting ERK1/2 signaling (<xref rid="pone.0119148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p><p>The expression of PTK6 is very intriguing. PTK6 is uniformly undetectable in benign lesions or in normal mammary tissues, but it is up-regulated in multiple tumor types, including breast, head and neck, ovarian and lung tumours [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Due to its overexpression in various cancers, more and more studies have tried to uncover the role of PTK6 in the biological behavior of cancers. PTK6 associates with ErbB2 and promotes ErbB2-dependent Ras/MAPK signaling, suggesting PTK6 participates in tumour development [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. PTK6 can promote STAT3 activation leading to mammary gland tumorigenesis in mouse models [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PTK6 also cooperates with HER2 and Src to regulate breast cancer cell survival [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although several functions of PTK6 have been described, a role for PTK6 in papillary thyroid cancer has not been established. In this study we showed that S1P induces PTK6 expression and induces PTK6 activated ERK1/2 signaling, resulting in thyroid follicular carcinoma cell migration. Although, previous studies suggest that PTK6 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and cell proliferation, we did not find evidence to support a role for PTK6 in cancer cell proliferation or apoptosis in papillary thyroid cancer (data not shown). The reasons for this phenomenon need to be explored in future studies.</p><p>The function of the miR-17-92 cluster in cancer is controversial and poorly defined. Some studies indicate that the miR-17-92 cluster participates in carcinogenesis as a classical oncogene and is overexpressed in malignant tumors [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, one study has shown that the miR-17-92 cluster (especially miR-17, 20a) suppresses oral squamous cell carcinoma migration [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another study found that the miR-17-92 cluster is a tumor suppressor gene, because it regulates the oncogenes E2F1 and MYC to inhibit cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Those data indicate that the miR-17-92 cluster may be a potential tumor suppressor gene. In this work, we showed that miR-17 inhibits S1P-induced migration by directly targeting the 3&#x02019;-UTR of PTK6. Our results are in line with previously reported findings, although the exact mechanisms exacting remain unclear. MiR-17 belongs to the miR-17&#x02013;92 cluster, which also includes miR-18a, 19a, 19b-1,20a, 92a-1 [<xref rid="pone.0119148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other miRNAs in the miR-17&#x02013;92 cluster may also be involved in thyroid follicular carcinoma cell migration. Further studies are needed to verify these putative functions.</p><p>In summary, although more studies are needed to understand the delicate regulatory mechanisms of thyroid follicular carcinoma migration, our results provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for S1P induced migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>S1P affects ERK1/2 activation.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of PTK6 and ERK1/2 on S1P-induced migration of FTC-133 cells.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Screening for miRNAs that are involved in the S1P-induced signaling pathway and that target the 3&#x02019;UTR of PTK6.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>miR-17 down-regulates PTK6 expression in FTC-133 cells.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>miR-17 inhibits the S1P-induced cell migration through the PTK6-ERK signaling pathway in FTC-133 cells.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of miR-17 and PTK6 on S1P-induced ERK phosphorylation.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s007"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Correlation of PTK6 and miR-17 expression with clinicopathologic features in papillary thyroid cancers (PTC).</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s007.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s008"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Primers Used in Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119148.s009"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>The target sequence of PTK6 and ERK miRNAs.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119148.s009.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0119148.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chalfant</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Spiegel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>
