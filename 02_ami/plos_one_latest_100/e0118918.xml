These divergent regenerative responses are in part mediated by the growth-associated expression of select transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, MASH1/Ascl1a, is transiently expressed during the development of many neuronal subtypes and regulates the expression of genes that mediate cell fate determination and differentiation. In the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), Ascl1a is also transiently expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that regenerate axons after optic nerve crush. Utilizing transgenic zebrafish with a 3.6 kb GAP43 promoter that drives expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we observed that knock-down of Ascl1a expression reduces both regenerative gap43 gene expression and axonal growth after injury compared to controls. In mammals, the development of noradrenergic brainstem neurons requires MASH1 expression. In contrast to zebrafish RGCs, however, MASH1 is not expressed in the mammalian brainstem after spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, we utilized adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to overexpress MASH1 in four month old rat (Rattus norvegicus) brainstem neurons in an attempt to promote axon regeneration after SCI. We discovered that after complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord and implantation of a Schwann cell bridge, animals that express MASH1 exhibit increased noradrenergic axon regeneration and improvement in hindlimb joint movements compared to controls. Together these data demonstrate that MASH1/Ascl1a is a fundamental regulator of axonal growth across vertebrates and can induce modifications to the intrinsic state of neurons to promote functional regeneration in response to CNS injury.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke grants 09923 (MBB) and 056281 (DDP and MBB).

However, during development, neurons undergo a transcriptionally regulated temporal switch that limits their regenerative capacity [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whereas both mammals and teleosts undergo a developmental switch in which growth-associated genes are transcriptionally silenced, in fish many of these genes are reactivated upon CNS injury.</p><p>Reactivation of growth-associated genes during axon regeneration in zebrafish requires enhancer elements that are distinct from those used during development [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The conserved, regeneration-specific enhancer regions in fish homologues of the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] include a putative binding site for the evolutionarily conserved pro-neuronal transcription factor, MASH1. In mammals, MASH1 is transiently expressed in the developing retina [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and brain [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and directly regulates genes involved in axon growth [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, MASH1/Ascl1a is re-expressed after zebrafish CNS injury [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but not mammalian CNS injury.</p><p>We investigated the importance of Ascl1a in zebrafish CNS axon regeneration using morpholinos to knockdown Ascl1a expression in RGCs after optic nerve transection in transgenic zebrafish <italic>gap43</italic> reporter lines.

After mammalian SCI, the transplantation of Schwann cells (SCs) provides a permissive environment for axon regeneration and is currently being evaluated clinically (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT01739023). Here we demonstrate that following complete spinal cord transection and SC bridge implantation, rats whose brainstems were transduced with AAV-MASH1 exhibited both increased noradrenergic axon regeneration into the bridge and improvement in hind limb locomotion. Together, these experiments suggest that MASH1 expression is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism necessary for axon regeneration in teleosts that can be ectopically induced in mammals to promote regeneration and offers a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with CNS injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and reporter lines</title><p>Zebrafish husbandry and all experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

For the gene expression assays, 6&#x02013;9 month old <italic>fgap43</italic>:<italic>egfp</italic> zebrafish were anesthetized with 0.03% aminobenzoic acid ethylmethylester (Argent Chemical Labs, Redmond, WA), and their left optic nerves were fully transected one mm from the retina. The right eyes were left intact to serve as unoperated controls. Gene knockdown was accomplished by placing a small piece of gel foam soaked with MOs (Gene tools LLC, Philomath, OR) at the site of optic nerve transection. Three types of MOs were used: 1) a Ascl1a MO as previously described (n = 4) [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], 2) a negative control MO that does not target any zebrafish genes (n = 4) [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and 3) The gap43 transgene used in the study contains the 5&#x02019; end of <italic>gap43</italic> along with exon 1 that encodes the first 10 amino acids of the protein. The resulting transgene encodes an EGFP fusion protein that is targeted by the GAP43 morpholino (<xref rid="pone.0118918.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref>). The sequence used for morpholino synthesis is: GAP43 (start site) 5&#x02019; TCTTCTGATGCAGCACAGCATAGTC 3&#x02019;. All of the MOs were tagged with the red fluorescent tracer, lissamine. This allowed for identification of neurons that received MOs through retrograde transport.

Then a piece of gel foam soaked with Ascl1a (n = 6), GAP43 (n = 6), or negative control (n = 6) MOs was placed at the site of transection. Most of the gelfoam was dissolved by four days. After four days, remaining gelfoam was removed and a complete transection was performed one mm distal to the original injury, into which gel foam soaked with green fluorescent retrograde tracer (Alexa 488 conjugated dextran, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) was positioned to identify RGCs that had regenerated their axons. Three days after retrograde tracing, retinas were removed and prepared for frozen sectioning and fluorescence microscopy as described above. Images were collected from five sections per retina, which included sections from the center of the retina containing the optic nerve and two lateral sections on each side. RGCs that were injured and received the MO from the first transection were identified by the red fluorescence from lissamine. RGCs that regenerated their axons one mm past the original injury site were identified by green fluorescence from the tracer. The percentage of axon regeneration was calculated by counting the number of double fluorescent cells (yellow), divided by the total number of cells taking up the MO and multiplied by 100.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>To assess for relative changes in gene expression, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast Real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) with SYBR green fluorescent label (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD).

The experimental design and methods used in this study have been previously described in detail by Williams and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, twenty-one young adult female Fischer rats, obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Frederick, MD), each received two separate surgeries: first, the stereotaxic injection of AAV vectors and second, the complete transection of the spinal cord with the implantation of a SC bridge. In order to allow AAV vectors to form concatamers and achieve maximal transgene expression at the time of injury, the stereotaxic surgery was performed between two and six weeks prior to injury. The rats were twelve weeks of age and weighed 160&#x02013;180 g at the time of injury. Their hindlimb locomotion was assessed weekly, and six weeks after injury they were perfused for histological analysis. All surgical procedures and analyses were performed blinded to the experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>AAV vectors</title><p>Serotype 2 AAV vectors were generated by the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis Viral Vector Core, using the AAV Helper-Free System from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

All rats were tested one week before the stereotaxic injection surgery and one week before the transection/bridge implantation. Their bladders were expressed prior to testing. The rats were then tested on a weekly basis, for six weeks after the transection/bridge implantation. In the final week, the rats also were recorded with a video camera while being tested.

The modified 12 point scale pools scores on the 21 point scale.

In contrast to teleosts, following injury to the mammalian CNS, both extrinsic and intrinsic treatments will be required to induce axon regeneration and substantial functional recovery [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Results presented here not only support the notion that combination strategies are needed to repair the injured mammalian CNS, but demonstrate a novel proof-of-principle to alter the intrinsic state of brainstem neurons. The expression of a transcription factor, normally only transiently present during mammalian development, may revert adult CNS neurons to a state where they are capable of axon regeneration and functional repair.</p><p>Experiments with transgenic zebrafish elucidated mechanisms whereby MASH1 alters the intrinsic state of adult neurons and promotes axon regeneration. Through analysis of the GAP43 promoter, several potential sites of regulation were identified previously in zebrafish, including consensus E-box binding motifs [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], to which Class II bHLH proteins, such as Ascl1a, may bind. In the current study, knockdown of Ascl1a expression in zebrafish RGCs after optic nerve transection reduced both <italic>gap43</italic> gene expression and axon regeneration. Therefore, this likely occurred through Ascl1a directly binding to the E-box motifs. Furthermore, given that the knockdown of Ascl1a reduced RGC axon regeneration greater than the knockdown of GAP43 alone, Ascl1a probably promotes axon regeneration through the regulation of other genes in addition to GAP43, such as alpha Tubulin [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is supported by previous reports that MASH1 regulates axon regeneration associated genes such as c-Ret [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Ndrg4 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], HuD [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and NogoR [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The use of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrates that MASH1 directly binds to the cis-regulatory regions of genes associated with axonogenesis and axon guidance [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], including the RhoA inhibitor, Rnd3 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, Ascl1a/MASH1 appears to be a fundamental component of transcriptional complexes that promote axon regeneration.</p><p>MASH1 is expressed during the development of several neuronal populations, including noradrenergic neurons [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Unlike in adult zebrafish, MASH1 is not expressed after axonal injury in the adult rat CNS. To determine if MASH1 could promote axon regeneration in a mammal, AAV vectors were used to ectopically express MASH1 in noradrenergic brainstem neurons of adult rats. After complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord and implantation of a SC bridge, MASH1 led to increased noradrenergic axon regeneration into the SC bridge. Thus, MASH1 was able to induce axon regeneration in the same population of rat CNS neurons that transiently express MASH1 during development. The genes regulated by MASH1 in mammals are likely similar to those in teleosts given the conserved E-box motifs present in the promoter regions of genes associated with axon regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Thus, MASH1 may be converting adult CNS neurons to a developmental state that is capable of axon regeneration, not unlike the ability of MASH1 and other Class II bHLH proteins to reprogram various somatic cell types [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Although MASH1 exerts a robust effect on axon regeneration in the zebrafish, the observed effects in the mammalian CNS were modest. In addition to differences in the injury environment that may deter axon regeneration to a greater extent in mammals compared to lower vertebrates, intrinsic factors may be limiting the effects of MASH1 expression. One possibility is that Mash1 has reduced DNA accessibility due to a closed chromatin state. Hence co-expression with molecules/pathways that relax the chromatin such as p300 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] may be required to form transcriptional complexes that are more capable of inducing changes in gene expression. In addition, the efficacy of such complexes also may be improved through manipulations of miRNA [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Noteworthy is that MASH1 protein was not robustly expressed in all brainstem neurons infected with AAV-EGFP plus AAV-MASH1. Given that EGFP expression was not uniform across neurons, it could be that viral transduction was not equally successful in all neurons. In addition, negative regulators may limit MASH1 protein expression in adult CNS neurons. For example, Class V and VI bHLH proteins, Id and HES family members, respectively, are up-regulated after SCI [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and may sequester ubiquitous class I binding partners from other bHLH proteins [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Of these, Id1 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and Id2 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] limit the activity of MASH1, and Id2 decreases expression of GAP43 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and TrkB [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Id2, however, may be required for MASH1 expression [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], to induce axonogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and to improve the growth of injured sensory axons [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Given that Id proteins inactivate neurogenic repressors such as HES-1 [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], MASH1 and Id2 may function to re-program adult neurons by out-competing or sequestering, respectively, bHLH proteins that limit axon regeneration.</p><p>The observed improvement in hindlimb movements in MASH1 treated animals is consistent with the largest improvements observed in previous studies of complete thoracic spinal cord transection. There currently appears to be a &#x0201c;ceiling&#x0201d; for behavioral recovery following thoracic spinal cord injury that is likely due to the absence of axons being directly observed to regenerate across the distal interface and into the caudal spinal cord [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The improved behavioral scores in MASH1 treated animals are likely due to the increased regeneration of noradrenergic and/or potentially other brainstem neurons to the distal end of the bridge. These axons may have formed synapses with dendrites present at the caudal SC bridge/spinal cord interface as previously implicated by Williams and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this way, synaptic and/or extrasynaptic release of neurotransmitters at the distal interface could potentially influence central pattern generator activity [<xref rid="pone.0118918.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and thereby improve hindlimb movements to a greater extent in animals treated with MASH1.</p><p>In conclusion, Ascl1a/Mash1 expression is required for axon regeneration in zebrafish and enhances axon regeneration and functional recovery in rats. While both mammals and teleosts undergo a developmental switch in which growth-associated genes are transcriptionally silenced, in zebrafish these genes are reactivated upon CNS injury, in part dependent upon Ascl1a. Thus, the mechanisms by which bHLH proteins regulate growth-associated genes after injury were not conserved across vertebrates and this may explain the limited ability for mammalian CNS neurons to regenerate their axons. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved and developmental mechanisms that mediate a neuron&#x02019;s intrinsic ability to recapitulate axonal growth will reveal new treatment strategies for CNS repair and recovery of function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118918.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Data for optic nerve transection and spinal cord injury experiments.</title><p>The first dataset (<xref rid="pone.0118918.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) represents the relative fold change in EGFP gene expression over unlesioned controls for each experimental negative control or Ascla knockdown animal.
